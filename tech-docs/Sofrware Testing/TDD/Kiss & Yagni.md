## Keep it Simple, Stupid”, and “You Ain’t Gonna Need It
 
Kiss and Yagni are two overlapping software design principles. KISS means just like what it sounds like it means. Keep things simple. YAGNI means don’t build features and abstractions unless those features serve a specific _existing requirement_ (not a future requirement). TDD helps with that process by forcing you to work in small iterations, tackling one requirement at a time on an as-needed basis.
